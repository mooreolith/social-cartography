# social-cartography README
## About
This is a prototype for a graph editing suite. The live version resides at [github.io](https://mooreolith.github.io/social-cartography). 
There are two commands. Please forgive me my busy schedules and limited attention spans. Home projects don't carry the same urgency as work projects, some of these I pick up after years, sometimes to rebuild, sometimes to salvage parts. It's not done

## Commands
* The first command, FROM>TO (some unique text, the ">" symbol, some other unique text) creates a vertex with label FROM and connects it to another vertex, with the label TO. The edges go FROM -> TO
* The second command SUB@SUPER creates FROM, creates TO, and creates a middle vertex "SUB@SUPER", which represents the role of sub within super. The edges go SUB -> SUB@SUPER -> SUPER.

And that's it. To be honest, I'm not even sure the download function works, so don't pour too much time into this.
